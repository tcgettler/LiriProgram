#liri.js 
This application runs completely on node.js.  By typing in node liri.js and either concert-this, spotify-this, movie-this, or do-what-it-says, you can search for upcoming band performances, a spotify song, a movie, or what is on the random.txt file respectively. 

When searching using concert-this, enter in the artist's name and it will display each upcoming event date, venue, and venue location by city, state, and country.  You will then be asked if you would want to log the result, selecting yes will write the search result to log.txt. See https://drive.google.com/open?id=1REpfKy9tg0-279vzR_imI3TIM7_dLMM0 for picture of a search.

When searching spotify-this, enter in a song title for it to display the artist, song title, preview link if one is available, and the record it is on.  Again, you will be asked if you would like to log the result. See https://drive.google.com/open?id=184cAzt-HTpxM7s_PZwrR8mHvB7CmT7ax for a picture of a search.  If you do not enter in a song, the default search will be "What's My Age Again," by Blink-182.  See https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Y7S-qR462Cu29QPDMw98hOgL05YBW5JS for example.  

When searching for movie-this, enter in a movie title for it to display the movie title, date released, imdb score, rotten tomatoes score, countries released, languages supported, plot synopsis and actors featured.  See https://drive.google.com/open?id=17AUUwEHRP21dRA0rNAOOIIJTKbIhwAWR for example. If no movie is selected, Mr. Nobody will be the default search. See https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sz-b0SFc8ORUXHzdRS-k5vIr_KopVp9m for example.

Lastly, searching do-what-it-says will run the random.txt file which is a spotify-this for "I Want It That Way," by the Backstreet Boys.  See https://drive.google.com/open?id=1T7URjQT4KtBPI49wHFGlTgd3Bsj5-wCI for example.  

Again there is a prompt for every search if you want to log the results to log.txt.  This will be updated, not overwritten.  See https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MxXuZqGPNwcQ9zaAt7Z-YvlaFVlweRGw for an example of what logged search results look like.
